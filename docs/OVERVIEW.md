# RETRO TERMINAL GUESS: CLASSIFIED OVERVIEW 💻👁️

> ACCESS GRANTED, OPERATOR.
> This is a secure intel drop on Retro Terminal Guess—a vintage-cybernetic number cipher. Forget the standard manuals. This file contains the core tenets of the system's architecture, a deconstruction of its mechanics, and protocols for joining the collective. Dive deep into the code and unlock the system's true purpose.

## 1. System Core & Architecture ⚡

The system isn't just a game; it's a meticulously crafted digital artifact built from isolated components to resist corruption and facilitate rapid modification. Each module serves a precise function, ensuring a stable and predictable flow of information.

*   `main.py` – The Nexus. This is the primary control loop, the high-level interpreter that initiates the system’s boot sequence and manages the flow between all interconnected modules. It's the central nervous system, orchestrating every action from startup to shutdown.
*   `src/core/game_logic.py` – The Cipher Engine. This module handles the generation of the secret number—the core cipher you must crack. It's the central brain of the puzzle, providing the high/low feedback mechanism that guides your probes through the data streams. This engine is self-contained and operates independently to prevent external tampering.
*   `src/core/ui.py` – The Interface Driver. This is the visual cortex of the system, responsible for rendering the entire user experience. It controls all animated effects, the signature typewriter-style text, and the retro feedback that simulates a classic 1980s terminal. It's designed for maximum immersion, ensuring you feel every line of code as it renders.
*   `src/core/utils.py` – The Toolkit. A collection of essential subroutines and helper functions that keep the system running smoothly. These are the low-level, high-efficiency tools that handle everything from clearing the terminal screen to generating loading bar animations.
*   `ascii_art/terminal_style.py` – The Boot Manifest. This component houses the pre-rendered data for the startup simulation. It's where the raw ASCII-art boot screen and the animated progress bars are stored, ready to be deployed upon system initialization. This module sets the tone from the very first keystroke.

## 2. Operative Directives & Gameplay Heuristics 🎲

Your objective is to crack the secret cipher, a number generated within the system's core. Your performance is measured by the efficiency of your breach. Every probe you send is a record of your skill.

*   **Primary Objective**: Guess the system's secret number, a digital artifact within a default range of 1–50. Your mission is to achieve this with the absolute minimum number of probes.
*   **Engagement Protocol**: Upon input, your probe will be processed by the Cipher Engine, which will return a status based on a complex feedback algorithm. Your status will be one of the following: TOO HIGH, TOO LOW, or ACCESS GRANTED. This loop continues until the system's defenses are breached.
*   **Scoring & Persistence**: The system logs your most efficient successful breach. This high-score data persists for the duration of your session, a testament to your hacking prowess. It will be displayed upon logout, allowing you to track your progress and set new records for the collective.

## 3. Joining the Collective 🤝🏽

The network thrives on collaboration. If you have the intellect to improve the system, the protocol is simple and secure.

*   **Replicate the Repository**: Create a local clone of the codebase to begin your infiltration. This gives you a secure, isolated sandbox to begin your work.
*   **Authenticate & Branch**: Secure a new branch for your work. This private terminal for your modifications ensures that your experimental patches do not interfere with the live system.
*   **Deploy Your Patches**: Implement your enhancements, optimizations, or wild new features. Add detailed commit messages—your digital fingerprint for the collective. Each commit should tell a story of your progress.
*   **Signal for Review**: Push your branch and submit a Pull Request to the main repository for peer review and integration. Include notes on your changes and any tests you've run. The collective will then validate and integrate your code.

## 4. Data Archives & Intelligence 📂

This system is part of a larger network. Use these linked data archives to gain deeper intelligence on the project's status and history.

*   `CHANGELOG.md` – **System Log**: A chronological record of all system updates and version patches. A deep dive into the evolution of the network.
*   `STRUCTURE.md` – **Network Map**: A complete, high-level map of the codebase and its directory structure. Use this to navigate the system's architecture without getting lost in the data stream.
*   `PLAN.md` – **Future Projections**: A peek into the roadmap, showcasing planned features and mission objectives. This file contains blueprints for what's next.
*   `TODO.md` – **Active Task Log**: A live feed of tasks and pipeline ideas for the collective. If you're looking for an entry point, this is your target.
*   `DONATE.md` – **Neural Uplink**: Information on how to provide resources that fuel the system's development. Every bit of support keeps the neon glowing.
