    This function displays a loading bar that fills segment by segment, simulating

    Args:
        total: Number of segments in the loading bar, determining the total bar length.

    Print retro terminal-style feedback based on the guess result.

    This function provides feedback messages in a retro terminal style depending
    on the player's guess outcome. The messages inform the player whether their
    guess is too low, too high, correct, or out of the allowed range.

    Args:
        result: The outcome of the player's guess. Expected values:
            - "low": The guess is below the target number.
            - "high": The guess is above the target number.
            - "correct": The guess matches the target number.
            - "out_of_range_low": The guess is less than 1.
            - "out_of_range_high": The guess is greater than max_num.
        target: The target number (used only if result is "correct"). Defaults to None.

            the built-in print function. This allows redirecting messages to
